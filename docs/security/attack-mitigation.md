# Attack Surfaces and Mitigations

Jason's distributed architecture creates multiple attack surfaces that require systematic analysis and layered defense strategies. Understanding these vectors enables both effective deployment security and research into IoT network protection effectiveness.

## Physical Attack Surfaces

### Hardware Component Access
**Attack vector**: Direct physical access to any of the three SBC components provides multiple compromise paths. An attacker with temporary physical access can extract SD cards, connect debugging interfaces, or install hardware implants.

**Exploitation mechanics**: SD card removal enables offline filesystem analysis, cryptographic key extraction, and configuration modification. UART debugging ports provide root console access without authentication. GPIO pins enable hardware keyloggers or network traffic interception devices.

**Impact analysis**: Complete system compromise including cryptographic keys, network topology, security policies, and authentication credentials. The attacker gains persistent access to all network traffic and can modify security configurations without detection.

**Current mitigations**:
- **Physical security requirements**: Deployment in controlled access environments
- **File system encryption**: Encrypted root filesystems prevent offline analysis
- **Debug port protection**: Physical removal of debug headers after deployment
- **Tamper-evident enclosures**: Detection of physical access attempts

**Enhanced mitigation strategies**:
```
# Implement LUKS encryption on SD cards
cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/mmcblk0p2
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/mmcblk0p2 encrypted-root

# Disable UART debugging in production
echo "enable_uart=0" >> /boot/config.txt
echo "console=" >> /boot/cmdline.txt

# GPIO pin security hardening
echo "gpio=2=op,dh" >> /boot/config.txt  # Disable unused GPIO
```

### Supply Chain Compromise
**Attack vector**: Malicious modification during hardware manufacturing, shipping, or storage before deployment. Compromised SD cards, modified firmware, or hardware implants inserted during supply chain.

**Exploitation mechanics**: Pre-installed backdoors in bootloaders, kernel modifications that bypass security controls, hardware-level network packet interception, or cryptographic key leakage through side-channels.

**Impact analysis**: Undetectable compromise that appears as legitimate hardware while providing attacker access to all network communications and security bypasses.

**Current mitigations**:
- **Hardware verification**: Cryptographic verification of bootloader and kernel signatures
- **Trusted suppliers**: Purchasing from verified distributors with chain of custody
- **Initial security validation**: Comprehensive security scanning before deployment

**Enhanced mitigation strategies**:
```
# Implement measured boot verification
echo "device_tree_address=0x100" >> /boot/config.txt
echo "device_tree_end=0x8000" >> /boot/config.txt

# Boot integrity verification
sha256sum /boot/bootcode.bin /boot/start.elf > /boot/integrity.hash
```

## Network Attack Surfaces

### Wireless Protocol Exploitation
**Attack vector**: Attacks against WPA3-SAE implementation, wireless driver vulnerabilities, or radio frequency interference. Sophisticated attackers may exploit cryptographic implementations or protocol state machines.

**Exploitation mechanics**: WPA3 downgrade attacks forcing weaker authentication, driver buffer overflows through malformed wireless frames, or denial-of-service through deauthentication floods despite Management Frame Protection.

**Impact analysis**: Unauthorized network access, disruption of legitimate devices, or compromise of the access plane component leading to broader network infiltration.

**Current mitigations**:
- **WPA3-SAE exclusive mode**: Disabling WPA2 fallback prevents downgrade attacks
- **Management Frame Protection**: Mandatory MFP prevents deauthentication attacks
- **Rate limiting**: Connection attempt throttling prevents brute force attacks
- **Client isolation**: Layer-2 isolation limits lateral movement after compromise

**Enhanced mitigation strategies**:
```

uci set wireless.@wifi-iface.wpa_disable_eapol_key_retries='1'
uci set wireless.@wifi-iface.sae_anti_clogging_threshold='10'
uci set wireless.@wifi-iface.max_listen_interval='10'

# Implement wireless IDS monitoring
echo "monitor_mode_interface=mon0" >> /etc/config/wireless
```

### Inter-Zone Communication Attacks
**Attack vector**: Exploitation of VLAN implementation, firewall rule bypasses, or protocol tunneling to escape security zone restrictions.

**Exploitation mechanics**: VLAN hopping through double-tagging attacks, firewall rule logic errors that permit unauthorized traffic, or protocol encapsulation that bypasses deep packet inspection.

**Impact analysis**: Lateral movement between security zones, access to restricted network segments, or compromise of isolation boundaries that form the core security model.

**Current mitigations**:
- **Default-deny policies**: All inter-zone traffic explicitly prohibited unless permitted
- **VLAN security**: Native VLAN restrictions and VLAN access control lists
- **Stateful inspection**: Connection state tracking prevents protocol abuse

iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state INVALID -j LOG --log-prefix "INVALID_STATE: "
iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state INVALID -j DROP
```

### DNS-Based Attack Vectors
**Attack vector**: DNS poisoning, cache poisoning, amplification attacks, or exploitation of DNS resolver vulnerabilities to compromise network security or redirect traffic.

**Exploitation mechanics**: Forged DNS responses bypassing DNSSEC validation, cache poisoning through birthday attacks, or DNS tunneling for data exfiltration and command-and-control communication.

```

## Comprehensive Defense Strategy

### Layered Security Implementation
**Defense in depth**: Multiple independent security controls ensure that single point failures don't compromise entire system security.

**Implementation approach**:
1. **Physical security**: Controlled access, tamper detection, and secure deployment
2. **Network security**: Segmentation, encryption, and monitoring
3. **System security**: Hardening, patching, and access controls  
4. **Application security**: Service isolation, input validation, and privilege restrictions
5. **Operational security**: Monitoring, incident response, and recovery procedures

### Continuous Security Monitoring
**Real-time threat detection**: Automated monitoring systems that provide immediate notification of security events and potential compromises.

```
# Comprehensive monitoring script
#!/bin/bash
# Jason security monitoring

# Check for unauthorized configuration changes
find /opt/jason/config -newer /opt/jason/.last-check -type f -exec echo "Config change: {}" \;

# Monitor for suspicious network activity  
ss -tuln | awk '$1=="LISTEN" && $4!~/:22$/ && $4!~/:53$/ {print "Unexpected listener: " $4}'

# Check container health and resource usage
docker stats --no-stream --format "table {{.Container}}\t{{.CPUPerc}}\t{{.MemUsage}}"

# Update baseline timestamp
touch /opt/jason/.last-check
```

### Incident Response Preparation
**Automated response capabilities**: Pre-configured responses to common attack scenarios that minimize impact and preserve evidence for analysis.

```
# Incident response automation
#!/bin/bash
# Automated incident response for Jason

case "$1" in
  "compromise-detected")
    # Isolate affected component
    iptables -A INPUT -s $2 -j DROP
    # Preserve evidence
    docker exec jason-rsyslog cp /logs /evidence/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
    # Alert administrators
    echo "Security incident detected: $2" | mail -s "Jason Security Alert" admin@organization.com
    ;;
  "performance-degradation")
    # Check resource utilization
    top -bn1 | head -20 >> /opt/jason/logs/performance-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log
    # Restart affected services if needed
    docker compose restart
    ;;
esac
```

This comprehensive analysis of attack surfaces and mitigations demonstrates that while Jason faces significant security challenges due to its hardware constraints and distributed architecture, **systematic application of security principles** can create effective defense against realistic attack scenarios. The key insight is that **perfect security is impossible**, but well-designed layered defenses can raise attack costs sufficiently to deter most threat actors while providing adequate protection for the platform's intended use cases.

The mitigation strategies focus on **practical implementation** rather than theoretical perfection, acknowledging resource constraints while maximizing security effectiveness within those boundaries. This approach enables organizations to make informed risk decisions based on realistic threat models and available defensive capabilities.
