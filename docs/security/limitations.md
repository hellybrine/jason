# Present Limitations

The current implementation faces specific constraints that affect deployment scenarios and operational effectiveness. These limitations reflect the realities of building on consumer hardware and highlight areas requiring careful consideration or alternative approaches.

## Hardware Security Fundamentals

### Absence of Secure Boot Chain
**Critical gap**: None of the SBC platforms provide authenticated boot sequences. The Raspberry Pi, NanoPi R1S, and R2S lack Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) or Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) that would prevent firmware tampering. An attacker with physical access can modify bootloaders, kernels, or root filesystems without detection.

**Practical impact**: Deployed devices cannot verify their software integrity. A compromised SD card appears identical to legitimate hardware, making supply chain attacks and physical tampering undetectable. This represents a **fundamental trust boundary violation** in security-critical deployments.

### Physical Access Vulnerabilities
**Removable storage creates immediate compromise vectors**. MicroSD cards can be extracted, cloned, and modified in minutes. Unlike enterprise hardware with tamper-evident seals and encrypted storage, Jason's components are **completely vulnerable to physical access attacks**.

**Real-world scenario**: An attacker gaining temporary access to a deployment site can clone all three SD cards, extract cryptographic keys, network configurations, and authentication credentials. The devices continue operating normally while providing the attacker with complete network access and security policy knowledge.

### Cryptographic Key Storage Limitations
**No hardware-protected key storage** exists on any platform component. Private keys, certificates, and shared secrets reside in filesystem storage that becomes accessible once physical access is achieved. Software-based key protection provides **no defense against determined physical attacks**.

**Operational consequence**: Certificate-based authentication, VPN keys, and inter-component authentication secrets remain vulnerable to extraction. Organizations requiring cryptographic key protection must implement external HSMs, significantly increasing deployment complexity and cost.

## Processing and Performance Boundaries

### Cryptographic Operations Bottleneck
**ARM Cortex-A53 processors lack dedicated cryptographic acceleration**. VPN termination, certificate validation, and encrypted traffic analysis consume significant CPU resources. The NanoPi R2S achieves approximately 50-100 Mbps VPN throughput compared to 1+ Gbps requirements in modern networks.

**Current measurement**: IPSec VPN processing saturates CPU cores at 60-80 Mbps, while SSL/TLS certificate validation for 100+ concurrent clients creates processing delays exceeding 5-10 seconds. These represent **hard performance ceilings** that cannot be overcome through software optimization.

### Deep Packet Inspection Limitations  
**Insufficient processing power for application-layer analysis**. Modern malware detection, behavioral analysis, and content filtering require computational resources exceeding SBC capabilities. ClamAV virus scanning reduces overall throughput by 40-60% when enabled.

**Detection capability gaps**: Advanced persistent threats, encrypted malware, and sophisticated attack techniques remain undetectable without application-layer analysis that **exceeds current platform capabilities**.

### Memory Constraints Affecting Security Services
**Limited RAM creates service competition**. The R1S with 512MB RAM cannot simultaneously run comprehensive logging, behavioral analysis, and wireless client management without memory pressure. The services plane requires careful resource allocation to prevent **security service degradation**.

**Container resource conflicts**: CrowdSec, Unbound, and monitoring services compete for available memory. Under high load, the Linux kernel may terminate security-critical processes to prevent system failure, creating **unpredictable security gaps**.

## Network Architecture Constraints

### Single-Site Deployment Model
**No distributed deployment capability** exists in the current architecture. Organizations with multiple buildings, remote locations, or geographically distributed infrastructure must deploy completely independent Jason instances without centralized management or policy coordination.

**Management scaling problems**: Ten remote sites require ten independent configurations, updates, and monitoring systems. Policy changes must be manually replicated across deployments, creating **consistency and maintenance challenges**.

### Limited Multi-Tenancy Support
**Single-organization security model** prevents shared infrastructure deployment. Service providers cannot isolate customer networks or implement per-customer policies within a single Jason deployment. Each customer requires **dedicated hardware infrastructure**.

**Economic scaling issues**: Cloud-based or managed security services cannot leverage Jason's architecture without deploying dedicated hardware per customer, eliminating economies of scale that make managed services economically viable.

### WAN Integration Gaps
**No enterprise routing protocol support**. OSPF, BGP, MPLS, and SD-WAN integration require capabilities exceeding current platform specifications. Jason operates as a **network edge solution** but cannot replace enterprise core networking infrastructure.

**Inter-site connectivity limitations**: Site-to-site VPNs, MPLS integration, and enterprise WAN connections require processing and protocol support unavailable in the current implementation.

## Software and Integration Limitations

### Enterprise Directory Integration Complexity
**Limited LDAP/Active Directory integration** in the current OpenWrt and IPFire configurations. Enterprise authentication, group policies, and centralized user management require manual configuration that **exceeds typical deployment complexity**.

**Certificate management challenges**: PKI integration, certificate renewal, and enterprise certificate authority support require additional infrastructure beyond the base platform capabilities.

### Network Management Protocol Gaps
**Minimal SNMP and enterprise monitoring integration**. Network management systems, enterprise monitoring platforms, and compliance reporting tools require protocol support and data export capabilities not included in base configurations.

**Standardized logging format inconsistencies**: Different components generate logs in various formats, requiring custom parsing and correlation logic that **complicates integration** with enterprise security information and event management (SIEM) systems.

### Vendor-Specific Protocol Support
**Proprietary IoT protocol handling limitations**. Zigbee, Z-Wave, LoRaWAN, and vendor-specific protocols require additional hardware and software that increases deployment complexity beyond the base three-node architecture.

**Industrial protocol support gaps**: Modbus, BACnet, CIP, and other industrial communication protocols require specialized knowledge and configuration not covered in standard deployment procedures.

## Operational Complexity Challenges

### Multi-Component Update Coordination
**No unified update mechanism** across OpenWrt, IPFire, and containerized services. Security patches require coordinated updates using different procedures for each component, creating **operational complexity and potential compatibility conflicts**.

**Rollback complexity**: Configuration changes affecting multiple components cannot be easily reverted. Failed updates may require complete redeployment rather than simple rollback procedures available in enterprise appliances.

### Expertise Requirements for Effective Deployment
**Significant technical knowledge prerequisite**. Effective Jason deployment requires networking, Linux administration, Docker, wireless security, and firewall configuration expertise. Organizations lacking dedicated technical staff face **deployment and maintenance barriers**.

**Troubleshooting complexity**: Problems may span wireless protocols, VLAN configuration, firewall rules, DNS resolution, and container orchestration. Effective problem resolution requires **broad technical competency** across multiple domains.

### Monitoring and Alerting Complexity
**No unified monitoring dashboard** provides comprehensive security posture visibility. Administrators must monitor OpenWrt wireless logs, IPFire firewall events, and containerized service health through separate interfaces and log files.

**Alert correlation challenges**: Security events from different components require manual correlation to identify coordinated attacks or system-wide issues. This **increases response time** and may result in missed security incidents.

## Scalability Reality Checks

### Device Population Hard Limits
**Current testing validates 50-100 IoT devices maximum** before performance degradation affects security enforcement. DHCP lease exhaustion, ARP table overflow, and wireless client association limits create **definitive capacity boundaries**.

**Connection tracking limitations**: The NanoPi R2S connection tracking table supports approximately 8,000-16,000 concurrent connections before memory exhaustion. Enterprise environments often exceed these limits during normal operation.

### Geographic Coverage Constraints
**Single wireless access point coverage** limits physical deployment scope. Large facilities require multiple access points that exceed the single R1S capability, necessitating **external wireless infrastructure** that complicates the security model.

**Wired infrastructure requirements**: The two-port R2S limitation requires managed switch infrastructure for VLAN support, adding external dependencies that increase deployment complexity and potential failure points.

### Bandwidth Processing Ceilings
**Gigabit Ethernet represents maximum throughput** capability. Modern networks operating at 10+ Gbps speeds cannot be protected by Jason without significant **traffic engineering and load balancing** across multiple deployments.

**Quality of Service limitations**: Traffic shaping and bandwidth management become ineffective when network demands exceed platform processing capabilities, potentially **compromising security enforcement** during high-traffic periods.

## Research Platform Constraints

### Experimental Isolation Challenges
**Limited ability to isolate experimental variables** in multi-service deployments. Research requiring controlled modification of specific security policies may affect multiple interdependent services simultaneously.

**Baseline establishment complexity**: Creating consistent experimental baselines requires coordinating configuration across three independent systems, increasing **experimental setup complexity** and potential for configuration drift.

### Data Collection and Analysis Limitations  
**Storage constraints limit research data retention**. Extended research periods requiring comprehensive logging may exceed SD card capacity, necessitating external storage that complicates deployment architecture.

**Processing limitations affect real-time analysis**. Research requiring immediate data processing and correlation may exceed platform computational capabilities, requiring **external analysis infrastructure**.

## Present Mitigation Approaches

These present limitations define Jason's **appropriate application boundaries** rather than fundamental design flaws. The platform excels within small-to-medium deployments, research environments, and organizations prioritizing transparency and customization over maximum performance. Understanding these constraints enables realistic deployment planning and appropriate security architecture decisions.

The limitations also highlight **development priorities** for platform evolution: hardware security integration, performance optimization, and operational simplification represent the most impactful areas for future enhancement.
