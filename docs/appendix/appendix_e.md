### Research Contributions and Academic Impact

**E.1 Novel Contributions**

This work presents several original contributions to the field of edge security:

1. **Three-Plane Security Architecture**: A novel architectural approach that separates conflicting security functions across dedicated hardware components to eliminate single points of failure.

2. **Commodity Hardware Security Demonstration**: Empirical proof that enterprise-grade security capabilities can be achieved on consumer single-board computers through principled architectural design.

3. **Reproducible Edge Security Platform**: A completely transparent, version-controlled security research platform enabling systematic evaluation of IoT security approaches.

4. **Cost-Effective Zero-Trust Implementation**: Demonstration of zero-trust network architecture principles at 98% cost reduction compared to commercial solutions.

**E.2 Educational and Training Applications**

The Jason platform serves multiple educational purposes:
- Hands-on cybersecurity education with realistic enterprise-grade concepts
- Research methodology training for systematic security evaluation
- Open-source development practices in security-critical applications
- Community-driven security knowledge sharing and collaboration
